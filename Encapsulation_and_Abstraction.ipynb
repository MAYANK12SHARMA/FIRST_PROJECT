        "You are tasked with designing a simple Bank Account Management System using object-oriented programming principles in Python. The system should be able to handle basic operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry for a bank account. Implement encapsulation to ensure data integrity and restrict direct access to the internal state of the bank account.\n",

        "- Account holder's name\n",
        "- Account balance\n",
        "- Provide an initialization method (__init__) to set the initial values of the account holder's name and balance. If no balance is specified, it should default to zero.\n",

        "Implement methods for the following operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Deposit: Add a specified amount to the account balance.\n",
        "- Withdraw: Deduct a specified amount from the account balance. Ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the account balance.\n",

        "- Get Account Holder: Retrieve the name of the account holder.\n",
